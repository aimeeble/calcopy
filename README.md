# Cal Copy

Copies all events from a corproate gSuite's calendar to a personal Google
calendar.

This is a work-around for restrictive corporate policies that do not let you
share event details outside the domain. This restriction makes it difficult to
have your Google Home be aware of your next meeting, etc. With the copied
events to a personal calendar, these works.

To preserve some semblance of corporate secrecy, the script does NOT copy the
description, attendee list, location, video conference details, etc. It only
copies the title and start/stop times.
